# Relational-Schema-Properties-Normalization
I'm working on calculators and verifications for different properties and normal forms of relational schemas.

I will be able to find the candidate keys of a schema.  
I plan to find the closures of attributes as well
as develop verifiers and calculators for BCNF and 3NF.
I will be looking into adding checks for the lossless join property
and dependency preservation property.
